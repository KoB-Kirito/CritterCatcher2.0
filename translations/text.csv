KEY_START_TEXT_1, Captain Jones found a wealthy collector to sponsor our sub repairs. Now I'm obliged to scour these unknown depths in search of rare specimens for some snobby aristocrats fish tank..
 Lets take it nice an easy, I don’t want to crack the sub like Ringo did last week. 
KEY_START_TEXT_2, Woah! These currents are strong!
KEY_ENDING_TEXT_1, This should be enough to keep Captain Jones happy. Once we transport these specimens to his collector will have enough cash to keep funding our [treasure hunt] for a while!
I know [shipwrecked name] is down here, I can feel it in my bones...
